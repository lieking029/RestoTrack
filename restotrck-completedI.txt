CHAPTER 1
Introduction
In this ever faster and growing digital economy, it is becoming increasingly difficult for
many small to medium businesses to efficiently handle their sales and inventory. Monitoring
inventory and processing sales manually is time consuming and can result in errors. By using
the Point of Sale (POS) and Inventory System, these problems can easily be relieved as the
system can definitely speed up the process through faster and more accurate recording of items
and be more organized in many different aspects. Overview of the Project This is developed to
develop a Web and Mobile-Based Inventory and POS Management System Using B-Tree
Indexing Algorithm that will provide the business a more efficient inventory and sales
management.
In order to solve the operational problems, the applicants propose an overall combination
of Inventory and POS (Point Of Sales) system with data analytics functions. This product is
created to handle sales, enable live inventory monitoring and carry out the inventory updates in
an automatic manner, with the aid of a powerful sales report. With features like best-selling
items, inventory levels and extensive reporting, the system’s goals are to help restaurant owners
make decisions that are based on data that will improve their operations and keep customers
happy. Extendaretail (2025) opines that contemporary POS systems with analytics capabilities,
support businesses in simplifying procedures and enhancing service provision through the
provision of timely information and automation of processes. Furthermore, Number Analytics
(2023) also emphasises that companies that apply POS data analytics will benefit from
remarkable sales performance and inventory accuracy improvements which in turn facilitate
more accurate forecasting and decision making.
RestoTrack: A Web and Mobile based Inventory and POS Management Utilizing B - Tree Indexing Algorithm 7
Small and medium businesses often struggle with sales and inventory
management, particularly when relying on manual practices. These procedures can be time
consuming, error prone, and not easily monitored for stockroom and reporting. One of which is
Hapag sa Marikina, in which its local restaurant have a hard time nowadays on how they keep
the count of the inventory and the transaction of their sales. To mitigate these problems, the
proponents incubated this capstone project: the Web and Mobile-Based Inventory and POS
Management System using B-Tree Indexing Algorithm. The system is designed to streamline the
restaurant’s workings, from refining order-taking through real-time inventory updates to data
analytics to aid in decision-making. Features: real-time inventory tracking, your best sellers will
be detected and your sales reports will make it an invaluable tool for your future forecasts.
Extendaretail (2025), supported POS systems can facilitate businesses to make their operations
smarter by providing actionable, real-time information and automation. Number Analytics
(2023) also wrote that companies using POS data analytics experience higher sales and greater
inventory accuracy. This initiative will help Hapag sa Marikina to operate efficiently on a
day-to-day basis and to be able to grow through improved handling of data.
RestoTrack: A Web and Mobile based Inventory and POS Management Utilizing B - Tree Indexing Algorithm 8
Background of the Study
To run a restaurant effectively you need perfect coordination between processing orders,
keeping an eye on sales and controlling inventory. Small and midsize restaurants, however, still
rely on hand-operated processes, leading to errors, inefficiency and additional operating
expenses. Most of us have faced baristas or waiters writing orders down with pen and paper,
which then has to be passed on to the kitchen and to the cashier before we receive our order. This
method increases the risk of misdirected and non-delivered orders leading to a dissatisfied
customer and money lost.
Restaurants without an automation system face slow transactions, no sales tracking, and
wrong inventory. Without it, restaurant management struggle to keep control of the available
ingredients—a state of affairs that leads to either over-stock or shortages. Antiquated POS
systems also impede financial transparency and prevent accurate sales reporting, making it
difficult for business owners to know when they are making money and to make informed
decisions.
Hapag sa Marikina It was founded in 1984, with 36 staff and daily sales from 60,000 to
150,000 pesos in the restobar. At present, you have to take the order manually. Waiters take
orders from customers on paper and bring them to the kitchen and cashier. This (ordering in
person) system of order-taking elevates the chances of errors or lost orders, especially during
peak hours where foot traffic and orders are at its peak. It’s a bottleneck and it slows everything
down, with customers potentially left unhappy while waiting forever for someone to answer
their call. The restaurant has inventory management issues to deal with as well. Without
real-time tracking, you don’t know which ingredients are running low or have been
oversupplied. Sales are recorded on slips and are manually collated making it hard for the
RestoTrack: A Web and Mobile based Inventory and POS Management Utilizing B - Tree Indexing Algorithm 9
management to extract reliable and timely sales data to monitor the restaurant’s performance. For
this reason, a Smart System that can automate OPA, SM, and IM all in a single action would be
desirable. The proposed project will develop a system which will assist Hapag sa Marikina in
automating its operations, accuracy, and immediate feedback in order to have efficient business
operation.
To keep the operations up and running, cutting-edge restaurants have adapted to digital,
with the help of automated POS technology and inventory management solutions. These
technologies help restaurant operators enhance financial reporting and resource management
through dynamic data analytics, transaction speed and reduction in human error. The use of these
technologies ensures that sales and inventory information is more accurate, reduces the
dependency on manual calculations by people and simplifies the terms of your order fulfilment.

Significance of the Study
This study is beneficial to the following:
● To Company Owners and Stakeholders, Staff. This is an initiative to simplify store’s
order, sale and inventory management especially with Real-time tracking and
sales updates. Instead of relying on outdated, slow, and manual practices, the system
reduces errors, provides a better record of the financial history of a business, and gives
business owners and investors what they need to help a business grow and make better
decisions. It also saves the staff’s time by eliminating the need to record orders or count
stock by hand. That’s faster service, fewer errors and a less stressful day for every one.
In other words, the whole business is able to operate more smoothly with the system.
RestoTrack: A Web and Mobile based Inventory and POS Management Utilizing B - Tree Indexing Algorithm 11
● To Customers . Ultimately the customer also benefits indirectly from this project by the
faster and more accurate treatment. An efficient ordering process and instantaneous
updating of stock levels mean customers have an increased chance of receiving correct
orders quickly and every time. They never use the system, but their servicers are
improved because the restaurant’s internal operations get better.
● To Future Researchers. This project can provide a good reference for those student or
research looking for restaurant management systems and business automation. It offers
perspectives into the limitations of manual efforts, and how digitized methods can
help work be performed more efficiently. This study will provide the foundation for
other researches such as future technologies, system performance enhancement, and
additional features to cater for varying business model.
● To Developers. This project will give us a chance to use what we’ve learned to build
something that solves a real-world problem! The result among friends It is a hands-on
experience that enhances our learning in coding, design and problem-solving, as well as
the opportunity for us to create something useful and practical.
● To Information and Communication Technology (ICT). This initiative shows how
ICT tools can help updating business functions. The solution could be used as an
example of how inventory management and sales can streamline business operations,
minimize or eradicate human error, and deliver a scalable solution for growth.

CHAPTER 2
Theoretical Framework
This chapter addresses the literature, which includes research and publications that offer
current answers to particular issues, useful information about the subject, and support for the
study's advancement. In addition, it provides the system architecture, definitions of words, and
the conceptual framework using input, process, and output. Additionally, it was used to give a
comprehensive overview of the project.
Review of Related Literature and Studies
In this section, the proponents compiled several literature reviews that are relevant to the
study to identify the trends, gaps, and patterns between the literatures.
Trends in Inventory Management System
This work intends to provide Inventory Management Systems (IMS) that fit company
inventory data and may offer improved management and handling of product stock, client orders,
customer service, and order delivery. The intended user is the owner and staff, a small and
medium-sized retail store member, of which manual inventory control still prevails in Malaysia.
IMS notes client orders and tracks anticipated arrival of product stocks for reserve for the shop
inventory. The developer of this project employs PHP for backend system development and
HTML, CSS, JavaScript for front-end system development. This study also includes the Agile
software method stressing the iterative development process. The developer has completely
constructed the inventory management system, although there are still limits and future
improvements that might be made to the system. CSS, HTML, Inventory Management Systems
(IMS), JavaScript, PHP, Small and Medium Enterprise (SME). Keywords One of the key
RestoTrack: A Web and Mobile based Inventory and POS Management Utilizing B - Tree Indexing Algorithm 17
elements of the supply chains in retail establishments is inventory control. The store must update
the stock coming in or leaving every day or every week. Most of the retail stores have at least a
warehouse to keep their goods. Retail businesses offer delivery services via customer orders for
goods from warehouse inventory to keep customer satisfaction even in cases when the shop runs
without the product. An inventory control system helps a company monitor and manage its
business income and product inventory, enabling it to handle both. Simultaneously, it is also
necessary to ascertain the appropriate product quantity to replenish based on consumer and
market demand, therefore minimizing corporate loss of overstocking. Without a proper inventory
control system inside a company, many businesses risk particularly for retail stores such as
out-of-stock and product that is not sold due to market demand which will create dissatisfaction
to customer and business lost. Moreover, inventory management in an organization is done
manually, like in certain companies presently and in the past, while updating and verifying
inventory inventories in an Excel or logbook. These days, several web tools on inventory control
systems for companies handling stock and product management abound. Many businesses still
manually handle their merchandise, even with inventory control technologies available on the
market. This is so because company owners discover the inventory control system is expensive,
ugly, rigid, or inappropriate for their company. Thus, this work aims to create a less costly web
application of inventory management systems fit for small to medium companies. Literature
Review: A Synopsis of System of Inventory Management Most of the present inventory
management systems available on the market depend on staff members to enter and monitor the
products utilizing web applications of inventory control systems. These web applications are
created since many researchers help with time-consuming and ineffective jobs by addressing
similar issues with their clients when their inventory is managed manually. Designed to
RestoTrack: A Web and Mobile based Inventory and POS Management Utilizing B - Tree Indexing Algorithm 18
lower error on recording product stock into the warehouse inventory and improve the
process of product in and out of the warehouse inventory, an inventory management system for
an Indonesian company has been developed. The researcher has added basic functionality in the
system to reach that, which is the general usability of the view of inventory information data
containing product detailed report within time range and form template for maintaining the
inventory product information. From the research conclusion, the author's work of web-based
inventory management applications is efficient and effective which will minimize certain jobs on
inventory management (S Pasaribu, 2021). Most managers or owners of businesses, however,
would want different types of report systems and data that could swiftly assess their inventory
and product position for better planning. Technology students executed a comparable
development research project to create an inventory control system for AikTC Server Center.
Likewise, AikTC's manual tracking and recording of product stock issues shapes the inventory
management system; the server inventory management is done once a few days or weeks.
Though there is a slight variation in situation and usage when compared to past research studies,
the author system requirement calls for varied report information and statistical data generated
by AIKTC including inventory transaction, purchase, issue, and maintenance report (Aamir
Khan, Aasif Ansari, MD Ghalib, 2019).
Trends in Point of Sale's Transaction Data
A Point of Sale (PoS) may be considered a physical tool found in a physical store or point
of sale (PoS) in an online retailer. With new capabilities allowing retailers to track price accuracy
and to record promotional data, control inventory and buying behavior, the software of the PoS
devices is becoming more complicated (Hayes, 2023). Trade analysis, data analysis and
representation, data management, stock management, labor management, Customer Relationship

Management (CRM), execution of a loyalty program, food distribution feature, contact less
ordering and payment (StoreHub, 2023). Modern PoS may be made of some or all of these
functionalities. In inventory control, planning is a dynamic and complicated process including
the delicate balance of supply and demand, careful handling of stock level in IM, and
optimization of order fulfillment in SCM. One of the main challenges inventory planners have to
contend with is how to forecast demand accurately and determine optimal inventory levels for
their product assortments. However, datieremente (or possibly consequentially), due to Big Data
Analytics (BDA) becoming more available, inventory planners now have an extremely powerful
tool/web at their disposal, allowing them to easily choose how much stock to hold and
how much demand should be expected/required (Conjura in 2023). Big Data Analytics (BDA
has become more important in the supply chains in recent years. This growth is due to
the emergence of cloud computing technology, allowing companies to gather, transmit,among
their trading partners, store and effectively evaluate vast volumes of data. Furthermore, this
technology lets these supply chain partners share data and information in real time. Moreover,
BDA can be used in value-added SCM supply chains for terms of process development. These
possible advantages also include the improvement and operationalization of processes, the cost
reduction, and the increase of supply chain environment decision making (Lee & Mangalaraj,
2022). with borders of nations within the ASEAN breaking down.The spread of membership
resulting from the region where a point of sale (PoS) system appropriate with the regional QR
code payment method results in a gap. As a result, ASEAN works towards achieving the
following common QR code across Cambodia (KHQR), Indonesia (QRIS), Lao PDR (Lao QR),
Malaysia (DuitNow), the Philippines (QR Ph), Singapore (PayNow), Thailand (PromptPay), and
Vietnam (VietQR) where transactional data for Point of Sale activities becomes more resilient
RestoTrack: A Web and Mobile based Inventory and POS Management Utilizing B - Tree Indexing Algorithm 20
and made more uniformed. The process of converging bilateral schemes into a common
multilateral platform is being insisted upon and started under the Nexus Project's aauspices under
the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), as a necessary initial step in the realization of a
wide ASEAN QR goal. Purchase completed: consumer related data and environmental data such
as geolocation; consumer related data and transactional data; which includes item transaction,
item quantity purchased, and item amount spent- consumer related data and environmental data.
This wealth of data provide the merchant to access invaluable insights out of the big data
universe – insides which can be translated back to the merchant’s inventory management to
optimize it efficiently, and as a result: avoid the bad traction of over-stock, and on the same
time- predict with “deadly” accuracy on the consumer behavior and buying patterns. These
prediction capabilities, enabled through the use of the large dataset, are valuable for improved
decision making in MSME business sector (Sukha, 2023). Thus, the objective of this study is to
assess the extent to which retailers are cognizant of the innovation and benefits associated with
adopting Inventory Management (IM) component into their Point of Sale (PoS) system. This
invention could also simplify the daily routine.
The paper investigates issues and solutions of inventory management in e-commerce as
well as traditional industry. The work aims to implement the inventory management system that
can store and update data efficiently about dealers, suppliers, manufactured product and
availability of raw materials and to handle and navigate the data in a user interface easily
navigable for nontechnical people. This study is focused on the creation of a MongoDB database
for Java in NetBeans as front-end for backend data storage. MongoDB is chosen here because it
can handle unstructured data, which is typical for inventory control chores. The system can also
keep an eye on numerous blocks, including departments, inventory, raw supplies, businesses and
RestoTrack: A Web and Mobile based Inventory and POS Management Utilizing B - Tree Indexing Algorithm 21
staff. The authors of [11] offer a GUI to the NetBeans-developed system as Builder. The
interface It's developed to be intuitive, user are able to perform operations such as adding,
updating, deleting record without being a tech savvy user. The proposed system resolves
effectively the inconsistency problem, uneven order sizes and inaccurate stock control. They
bring out the robust customer service offered by the system, which is only possible due to proper
management of data in time. This work recommends further research areas like integrating the
system with other enterprise resource planning (ERP systems) and a study on the employment of
artificial intelligence (AI) in (e) Developed inventory management systems using application.
Trends in Existing Inventory Management Systems
This work helps to solve the problem of efficient systems of management gifts and
inventory for small and medium-‐sized businesses (SMBs). The researchers point out the
shortcoming of conventional inventory management techniques including manual recording and
spreadsheet-based systems, being error and time-inefficiency prone. The authors’ main aim of
this study is to design a mobile application system for inventory management to the small and
middle enterprises (SMEs) which could be user-friendly, accessible and providing real-time
information on the status of the inventory which will allow the SMEs to have better control over
their current inventory level. The proposed mobile application was developed using a structured
analysis and design methodology by the authors. The system was modularised to cater for
different user requirements. The application was developed in Android Studio (Front-end) and
managed the database in Firebase (Back-end). The combination presented a powerful and
scalable approach to managing inventory data. Yet, the paper could have profited from some
more in-depth reflections on potential problems and limitations when implementing such a
system. analyzedPotential can be The limitation of the work is that the research does not consider
RestoTrack: A Web and Mobile based Inventory and POS Management Utilizing B - Tree Indexing Algorithm 22
the problem such as data security, and do not compare experiments with other inventory
management systems. 1] which proposedDevelopment of Web Based Platform for
Automating Inventory Management of Small 56 Medium Enterprise, The study intends to solve
the inventory management problems for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) by means
of manual approaches. Like spreadsheets, traditional inventory control is time-consuming, prone
to mistakes, and essentially useless, the writers note. Usually, these strategies have negative
effects on a company's performance and lead to erroneous information shared inside, neglected
and disregarded policies. The major goal of the project was to create a web-based application
that would automate the inventory control for SMEs (who want to have a system that supports its
business processes, mistakes' reduction and productivity enhancement). The proposed system
was designed by the authors using a methodical approach combining design and analysis. Their
separation of the system allowed it to remain capable of reusing depending on different
consumer needs. Since the system was developed based on MySQL database that is strong and
expandable processing inventory data, contextualized a web-based system for automation of
inventory management system would bring much benefi t to SMEs. The system resolves the
shortcoming of manually operated inventory management approach, thus offering an efficient,
accurate and user-friendly solution. Adoption of similar computerized systems is advised on
to enhance with better service, to minimize undue stress and for the purpose of maintaining the
various inventories up-to-date. In comparison, such work is dumb, and it is constructed as an
independent system.
Trends in Research Indexing Algorithms
In this article, we study the indexing algorithms employed in advanced search engines,
such as the B-tree, reverse indexing, and data (proper) indexing techniques. With more and more
RestoTrack: A Web and Mobile based Inventory and POS Management Utilizing B - Tree Indexing Algorithm 23
electronic information, it is harder and harder to find the files you need quickly and really
quickly find the one that you wanted. Attempt at solution Software development companies
have offered products to address it. The article discusses proper indexing techniques, reverse
indexing, and B-tree data indexing methods. Some of the index types that the PostgreSQL
database system supports are B-tree, GIN, GIST, and HASH indexes. Only three of these -GIN,
GIST, and B-tree- are actually used. A B-tree structure is employed by modern database
management systems to maintain indexes and enhance searches performance.

Trends in Digital Transformation of the Retail Point of Sale in the Artificial Intelligence Era.
Digitalisation in the retail sector has transformed how the point of sale (POS) works. In
this age of artificial intelligence (AI), POS systems are super smart and advanced which in turn
are helping retailers work efficiently and enhance customer service as well as a drive in sales.
ML-driven POS machines are capable to treat all customer data and provide data-driven
recommendations about products/ services. A POS system driven by AI could analyze
customer purchase history and then suggest relevant items in which the customer may be
interested. One other aspect of digital transformation in retailing is the emergence of POS
systems which are now interconnected to other technologies like the mobile and the internet of
things (IoT) and augmented reality technology (ART) solutions. This has empowered merchants
to design an effective shopping experience and offer access to a greater selection of products and
services. The digital transformation of the retail store has redefined the way point-of-sale (POS)
systems function. Advanced POS systems and AI With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI),
POS systems are becoming smarter and more advanced, making it easier for retailers to enhance
RestoTrack: A Web and Mobile based Inventory and POS Management Utilizing B - Tree Indexing Algorithm 24
efficiency, customer satisfaction, and sales themselves. Artificial intelligence-based POS
systems can apply ML models to customer data, providing valuable recommendations on
products and services. It can listen to a customer's sales history and recommend other cross sells
that customer might be interested in. One other development of the digital transformation in
retail was the transformation of point of sale (POS) system inside retail stores to reduce the
siloed (difficult for different digital technologies to interact with) nature of POS, into the central
component of the retail systems ecosystem integrating not just payments, but other technologies
like mobile, internet of things (IoT) and augmented reality technology (ART). This has allowed
retailers to deliver convenient shopping and offer access to more products and services.
Trends in How Smart Waste Management System Works.
Retail companies are undergoing digital transformation and this has prompted substantial
modifications in the operation of point-of-sale (POS) systems. With the age of arificial
intelligence (AI) upon us, the intelligence level and functionalities of a POS system are growing
smarter that enable retailers to enhance efficiency, enhance customer satisfaction, and stimulate
sales. AI-based POS systems leverage advanced machine learning technology to interpret
customer data and generate intelligent suggestions for products and services. A POS system
driven by artificial intelligence could potentially be used to look up a customer’s purchase
history and recommend other items the customer may be interested in. This digital
transformation in retail sector has been also about the integration of the POS systems with other
technologies such as mo-bile devices, internet of things (IoT) or conventional money and AR
technology [7]. This, in turn, has permitted retailers to construct an efficient shopping experience
(e.g., in terms of shopping costs) and offer richer product and service offers. Four such industrial
revolutions have come since the first one in 1760, and each was a step forward in enhancing
RestoTrack: A Web and Mobile based Inventory and POS Management Utilizing B - Tree Indexing Algorithm 25
lifestyle and mankind thanks to better manufacturing processes. In the first revolution, steam
engines replaced much of human work, making things more efficient and cheaper. The second
revolution brought with it mass production assembly lines and electrification that
made high-quality goods cheaper to produce. A third revolution followed, the one in which
electronics, telecommunication and computers emerged and with them, internet shopping and
globalisation. Fourth revolution, also named as industry 4.0, aimed to link physical objects to
individuals and influence the retail field on a large scale (Reagan & Singh, 2020). Retails 1.0
and 2.0 gave rise to department stores and shopping malls, respectively, which offered
consumers access to inexpensive goods. As a result of the rise of online shopping, which is
known as Retail 3.0, consumers were able to buy whatever they wanted without going
anywhere, significantly changing purchase behaviours. The advent of Retail 4.0 technology
including such technological hit-ter as AI, IoT, Cloud Computing, Big Data Analytics (BDA),
Augmented Real-ity (AR), have made it possible to further improve and simplify the shopping
experience for consumers. AI can automate jobs urging an employee and IoT can operate home
and office applications using mobile applications. Retail 4.0 innovations have also been used to
enhance the sustainability of agri-food retailing. 202 Retail Point of Sale Digital Transformation
Through Kiosk Solutions Retailers were compelled to introduce self-service kiosks as an
economical means to minimize in-person interaction and safeguard their customers from
COVID-19 (Ernst & Young, 2020). Self-service kiosks allow users to self serve with certain
services, which makes the consumers more satisfied and have more control over their buying.
Retailers are finding that Retail 4.0 technologies enhance their business performance
and customer experience, in turn helping them to stay ahead in the marketplace. They are now
able to transition effortlessly between channels and enjoy an integrated, consistent, and uniform
RestoTrack: A Web and Mobile based Inventory and POS Management Utilizing B - Tree Indexing Algorithm 26
service across all channels. Recommendations can be tailored to individual consumers in order to
be more satisfying, increase customer loyalty as well as sales, and enhance profitability (Har et
al., 2022). In short, Retail 4.0 indicates a radical change in the retail sector, which is fostered by
the integration of digital technologies, e.g., IoT, AI, BDA, cloud computing, and social media.
Retailers can make customer experience more personal and convenient and at the same time,
enhance efficiency and cut costs, by using these technologies. In an evolving retail industry,
Retail 4.0 may prove to be increasingly important as the future of retail, new technology and
developments will continue to shape growth and change. AI means that retailers can now run
unmanned stores which cuts labor costs, BDA and cloud computing can analyze user data to
predict preference and provide personalized services. These technologies also add flexibility
and increase the efficiency of the distribution value chain. The internet of things is happening
and there is so much data streaming in that needs to be used to make decisions. There is a
critical need for progress in sensor technology for data processing, sharing, and collection
(Lueth, 2020). Location-Based Marketing Virtual assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant can
tell users about nearby retail locations that sell a product they are interested in as a result of
location data (Cate, 2019). Smart beacons, for example, can sense pedestrians walking by a store
and send the people electronic messages on their phones about deals that might entice them to
stop in and shop. Internet of things (IoT) will massively impact on the way data acquisition and
customer relationship management (CRM) systems develop in the future (Goldberg, 2021).
Nor does it support forecasting, replenishment, allocation, order management, and logistics
operations. 3.Using self-service kiosks at concession stands and in restaurants has increased
average order size by 20% and improved the method of inventory management. RFID
technology allows automatic object tracking and object identification, which results in minimal
RestoTrack: A Web and Mobile based Inventory and POS Management Utilizing B - Tree Indexing Algorithm 27
out-of-stock and out-of-shell occurrences and enhanced inventory turnover (Har et al., 2022).
The “intelligence” of the machine is its ability to “understand” and “learn” from the mining of
data, resulting in a form of automation that is smart and only requires human intervention
sporadically. AI-based automation complements and amplifies human skill, reduces human error
and paves the way for operational excellence, customer experience and service levels
enhancement in retail (Kalyani & Pawar, n.d.). The most recent types of vending machine, called
smart vending machines (VMs), which include voice and face recognition, apply deep learning
and machine learning methods to induce more users. The VMs are based on AI in figuring out
customer preferences and behaviours to display a visual interface with a focus offers
(Zimmermann et al., 2022). In China, JD. com Corporation Unique AI vend-ing machines for
fresh produce available 24 hours. This no-contact buying is valued by consumers in the
middle of the COVID-19 outbreak. The integration of AI in retail can save rent, labor cost, and
other costs by purchasing fruit from wholesale markets, helping local farmers and enhancing the
overall agri-food supply chain. For instance, Alibaba’s Cainiao network employs an AI-backed
smart inventory platform that unites the on-and off-line retailing universe (Lin, 2020). ART
amplifies sensory experiences, and mostly every other business use AR to enhance the
experience the customer is going to get. The Maker Experience by Nike deploys AR to empower
customers with the design a pair of shoes they can then buy in-store, (O’Brien, 2017). Shoppers
will be able to customise their Nike Presto X shoes and visualize through 203 Digital
Transformation of the Retail Point of Sale AR, object tracking, and projection systems. L’Oréal
has introduced a Shopee enabled, AR-powered tool that can help to match their desired lipstick
shade with the visualisation of their perfect lip shade based on their unique beauty need to better
their online shopping journey (Lim, 2019). Cloud computing is where computing power, data
RestoTrack: A Web and Mobile based Inventory and POS Management Utilizing B - Tree Indexing Algorithm 28
storage resources, software, and other information technology resources are provided to the user
as a service over the internet via a platform. Cloud Computing Retailers will need to invest in
cloud services to store, analyze and distribute the unprecedented volume of data that is created
by Retail 4.0. Cloud Computing is cheap, easy and perceived as the most cost-effective way
monitor the chain of supply, end-to-end. For instance, Sayurbox, Indonesia’s traditional
farmer-to-urban consumer e-commerce platform, has used cloud service provider AWS to handle
their supply chain from end-to-end, (Amazon Web Service, 2021). This allowed them to capture
demand, match it with supply sources, process a 300% daily growth in order volume, execute 24
hour product delivery, save customers 30% on production costs, and help farmers secure 20%
more revenue while lowering overhead via managed services (Har et al., 2022).
Trends in Data Analytics
Through abundant data sources, research is being increasingly brought forward to the
field of data analytics, which has grown considerably in scale. The evolution of analytics is the
subject of this paper. Those conundrums of large datasets and data engineering, along with the
whys of the technologies that exist to process such large amounts of data, are the focus of this
first half of the article. It will be a good book for academics who desire to employ data analytics
to derive insights from their data. Analysis is an adventure in understanding something;
data analytics is the journey to understand the data you already have. At its heart, this field
deals with data management which is accessible at any given time that includes the collection
and storage of such data sources along with methodology, tools, and strategies for assessing the
data. Data analytics is seeking connections, meaning, and patterns extracted through data
analysis and inference. Such evidence-based advices, not only orient companies in
decision-making, but also contribute with the generation of predictions and the improvement of
RestoTrack: A Web and Mobile based Inventory and POS Management Utilizing B - Tree Indexing Algorithm 29
efficiency (Marchena Sekli & De La Vega, 2021). Within the broad areas of socio-economic and
politics, management of forced migration, reliefs and rehabilitation works, climate change
mitigation, food waste reduction, effectiveness of Aid programs and the like activities, data
sciences are finding itself more and more inseparable from many of these philanthropic as well
as political Spectrum (Naikwadi et al., 2021). Entities and businesses will need to consider
adding Web 3.0 and the metaverse to their data analysis plans as the newness and popularity of
this virtual space grow. The kind of best insights and decision-making power is also expected to
come with the next wave of data analytics, through synergy of what people can do and what
artificial intelligence can do working in tandem, and building on each other. This will enable
enterprises to track their most valuable performance metrics and deliver market efficiencies.
Trends in Applications on Mobile Devices
The prevalence of mobile devices has made demand for literary translation in higher
education and individual learning, even higher. But today’s translation apps flinch at being asked
so much of the time to do the same thing, and the data sync/ offline capability is terrible. The
one of the big problem is to assure the quality of translation and fast data synchronization,
particularly in uncertain or broken network environment. The prevailing works focus on offline
mode local storage and updating methods. However effectiveness in translation can be impaired
by limited storage capacity and update procedures. Data-synchronization techniques similarly
have predominantly been explored under more benign network conditions with few treatments
of poor network conditions or unreliable network connectivity. This study focuses on the off-line
operation and data synchronization technologies in literature translation programs for portable
devices to address this issue. The research results can lead to new storage and update methods in
the offline mode, bring about higher data synchronization efficiency and robustness, and
RestoTrack: A Web and Mobile based Inventory and POS Management Utilizing B - Tree Indexing Algorithm 30
optimize the utility and user experience of translation tools. With the popularity of mobile
terminal and the rapid development of technology, the translation apps of literature are
becoming increasingly important for the purpose of academic study and daily study [1–3].
However, these applications face various challenges in data synchronization and offline
operation [4–6]. When used in mobile scenarios, users may encounter intermittent or
discon-nected network conditions and hence they rely more heavily on the oine functionality of
translation apps [7–11]. Quality of translation also helps facilitate.

Presentation Tier
Figure shows a 3-tier system architecture for the inventory and POS, which would
partition concerns into different layers. Users can interact directly through the front end,
consisting of Presentation Tier, designed at the top. It has screens like cashier login, POS
dashboard, inventory dashboard, admin dashboard, and manager dashboard. Data comes in from
users to this tier, and comes out – in the form of reciepts and reports. Underlying all of this is the
Logic Tier, which is the brains behind the system, containing packages for managing different
aspects like managers, admin, inventory and POS transactions.
This tier gets requests from the Presentation Tier and communicates with the data
storage below. 3- Data Tier This tier is responsible for storing the data of the system,
including databases for employee data, stock data, sales transactions and some security features
such as access control. External inputs are users and an admin/manager logging into the system,
as well as an internet connection to potentially enable online functionalities and a local database
which could be used e.g. for backup or specific data storage requirements. This layered design
provides for the organization, the scalability, the security, and the flexibility of the POS system.
Application Logic Tier
The steadiness-layer The Application Logic Tier is a main processing layer for the
RestoTrack system where all the business logic and communication between the user interface
and the database is structured in. These are basic modules that are programmed solely for
restaurant businesses. With the User Management Module, managers can create, edit, deactivate,
or delete individual employee accounts to maintain accurate employee records. The
Sales Reporting Module: This provides instant sales data and performance reports, so you can
RestoTrack: A Web and Mobile based Inventory and POS Management Utilizing B - Tree Indexing Algorithm 34
make informed and accurate decisions. 2.14 Stock Management: The Inventory Management
Module The Stock Tracking Module automatically checks the balance of inventory, the inventory
update for each sale, as well as how fast and how slow an item moves using the EOQ formula.
Menu Management Module allows an administrator to update, to archive, and to mark items as
unavailable when there is no stock available. The Ordering Module makes order taking easy by
enabling bartenders and servers to easily send messages to the kitchen and cashiers with
minimal mistakes. Cashier POS Module processes transactions and interacts with inventory
updates, also quicker. Finally, with the Kitchen Display System (KDS), incoming orders are
shown to kitchen staff in real time, guaranteeing the accuracy and efficiency. Taken together,
these modules allow restaurants to run smoothly from the front counter to the kitchen.
Data Tier
The Data Tier forms the basis of the RestoTrack System and looks after the billing
information and data that is at the heart of any restaurant operation. Employee Database - for
storing employee information such as personal details, positions, and employment history,
resulting in all innkeeper-related data to be well-maintained. The Sales Database records all
information from sales processing, including time of sale, items sold and payment information,
providing full and immediate reporting capabilities. Inventory Database monitors stock level,
ingredient consumption and expiry dates, all of which contribute to the efficient management of
inventory plus reductions in waste. The Menu Database encompasses all menu item information
such as availability, pricing and categorization. For security and privacy concerns, the Security
Measure including editable data storage, role base access control, and secure login mechanism
are included in this tier. Along with these features, these elements deliver the integrity,

CHAPTER 3
Research Methodology
RestoTrack is a web application that helps restaurants effectively manage their
point-of-sale (POS) and inventory management. The solution guarantees quick data retrieval,
efficient stock management, and smooth transaction processing for restaurant owners and
employees by leveraging indexing techniques. The method that Restotrack used in the project is
the Agile Methodology.
Product Design
This study aims to create RestoTrack, a web and mobile POS and Inventory
Management System made for Hapag sa Marikina, to help improve restaurant operations by
integrating sales and inventory process, and to improve the service flow of the restaurant.
The proposers will evaluate existing constraints on operations, particularly in manual inventory,
order processing and legacy POS systems, to collect necessary input for system design and
development. New ideas will be formulated to overcome inefficiencies, supported by specific
development targets and streamlined processes. Data will be gathered utilizing interviews, prior
research and publications to inform the design and features of the system. The scope of and
limitations on the project will be explicitly specified to ensure that the work remains feasible and
focused. The system will be created by Visual Studio Code as the bigger IDE, HTML, CSS

various modules will be fully integrated and will together create a seamless operating restaurant
and enhanced business decision making.
Design Discussion
Figure 3, Design 1 retains the light, uncluttered aesthetic used in earlier mock‑ups, but the
login form has been repositioned to the center of the screen. This centered layout enhances
usability: it immediately highlights the single task‑critical action—signing in—so users do not
have to scan the page to find it. The clear focal point reduces cognitive load, shortens decision
time, and ultimately provides a smoother, more intuitive experience for busy staff members who
just want to log in and begin working.

Influence of Design Trade-Offs in Final Design
Design Trade-Offs was considered as appropriate to this research work as it provides a
quantitative evaluation of the performance and appropriateness of proposed designs. This
allowed the designers to choose a plan that satisfies all constraints and outputs to optimize for
whatever fun they wanted to if it meets all study objective requirement. The load process, the
memory usage, and the response time were used to differentiate each of the three developer
designs.
● Criterion 1: Loading Process
First, the load time, loading often means how fast the query simulations are
performed. Therefore, the design choice will influence how accurate and successful plan
will be.
● Criterion 2: Memory Usage
Memory consumption is the size of the dataset to work on, an important constrain
as it influences the.
the assessment of the performance efficiency indicators.
● Criterion 3: Response Time
Response time is the response to the time a query is sent, and when the terminal
receives the response. It is an important measure regarding whether an interactive system
is effective, and non-compliance may affect system recovery.
Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity analysis is an approach to revenue modelling that examines the
potential effects of fluctuations in input values on targets. It is also referred to as a what-if
RestoTrack: A Web and Mobile based Inventory and POS Management Utilizing B - Tree Indexing Algorithm 52
model or simulation analysis. It's a method to predict what decision the affair can lead to based
on the factors that are relevant.

Project Development
InfoWorld (Sacolick, 2022) indicates that Agile emphasises on working software
and refers to teams being held accountable to deliver complete functionality and applications,
integration, and other working products that will have value to the system beneficiaries as
opposed to finished coding. Successful implementation of Agile practices requires to secure
collaborative procedures among team members in relation to the product being built, specific
task assignments, and the development workflow. The process starts with a Vision statement that
captures the problems, opportunities and values of what the project has set out to achieve. This
vision is a creation that originates from a product owner and is co-created with a cross-functional
team to help it become real.
Roles in Agile There are clearly defined roles and responsibilities in Agile Development
across the team. This approach is specifically poised for success on this project because it is
equally focused in its nature on intensive pre-design meetings and research; an tantamount
preliminary step to the success of projects. Moreover, by building continuous testing into the
Agile dev lifecycle, the risk of future bugs is lowered, increasing the likelihood of project
success.
The proponents will used the following throughout the conduct of the project
development:
Phase I: Planning
During the planning process, the proponents planned out the project timeline
deciding when the project has to be completed and which specific benchmarks must be
met. All members of the team get their specific tasks due to their skills – this is how the
RestoTrack: A Web and Mobile based Inventory and POS Management Utilizing B - Tree Indexing Algorithm 58
proponents avoid downtime in the project. Explicit goals and aspirations are formulated
in order to guide the development process and to ensure that the work remains consistent
with the needs of the project (Figure 13).
Phase II: Design
The design phase of the team concentrates on development of a simple to use
web application that serves the purpose of the organization. Mock-ups of the UI
are developed with focus on functionality and user friendliness. Design is iterated and
feedback is polished, with focus to improve user experience and include essential features
to best support the organization (figure 13).
Phase III: Development
During development you will be translating the design into working, code and
components. This involves installing and configuring the database, building out
the required back-end and front-end components and ensuring everything works
together. As the project is at its heart at this stage, the team is investing substantial
efforts to get the application work properly (refer Figure 13).
Phase IV: Testing
At this experimenting stage, the usefulness and usability of the web application
are adequately evaluated. The proponents tests the software to verify that it meets the
demand of the business, testing for bugs, glitches, usability and other limitations.
Feedback from such tests is applied to refine the program and provide successfull
execution on different deployment environments (Figure 13).
RestoTrack: A Web and Mobile based Inventory and POS Management Utilizing B - Tree Indexing Algorithm 59
Phase V: Implementation
In the implementation phase, the web and mobile applications are pushed into a
staging or test environment where they are tested for proper configuration and
connectivity with all the system parts. The team carries out the last rounds of functional
validation, simulates how the product will be used in real life, and checks the system’s
stability before the real release. This stage is about technical readiness, ensuring that the
application works well and does what is required. Internal feedback is received and used
to solve any last-minute problem before the System is assumed ready for full
deployment. (Figure 13).
Phase VI: Evaluation
The team assesses the success of the web application in relation to the initial
project objectives and quality requirements in the evaluation phase. It would include
soliciting corpora user feedback, assessing system usability, reliability, and system
functionality, and running performance evaluations. The team uses this data to determine
success, such as if the application meets user expectations and business objectives. The
recommendations based on the results are further improvements or future versions of the
system (Figure 13).
Phase VII: Launch
In the launch phase, the web application is deployed to a targeted audience.
The team is overseeing the coordinated launch so that everything falls into place. This
phase includes user on-boarding events and support to early users. The launch success is
RestoTrack: A Web and Mobile based Inventory and POS Management Utilizing B - Tree Indexing Algorithm 60
very well tracked, and any short-term post-launch failures are addressed quickly to
uphold user satisfaction and application stability (Figure 13).
Figure 13
Agile Development Process
Testing and Operating Procedures
The testing and operating procedures for the POS and Inventory System are conducted in
a structured manner to ensure the system meets the defined functional and non-functional
requirements. These procedures are designed to validate system performance, usability, and
reliability before deployment. The process follows four main stages:
RestoTrack: A Web and Mobile based Inventory and POS Management Utilizing B - Tree Indexing Algorithm 61
● Formulate a Test Plan
A detailed test plan is written to document test scope and objective, test resources,
duration and detailed test cases. This is comprised of unit testes, integration testes and
user acceptance tests (UAT).
● Perform System Testing
The test scenarios are run to validate every system module such as orders processing,
inventory updates, sales reporting, and tracking. Any errors and bugs that arise are
noted and resolved.
● Analyze Test Results
The test results are compared against the required system behavior. It is used to verify
data integrity, load performance and check response times in different screen resolutions
across different devices.
● System Deployment and Monitoring
The system is then used in a real environment following successful tests. Performance
and usage are observed via monitoring tools, and final adjustments are made to enable,
for example, resolving potential issues.

Figure 14
Testing and Operating Procedures
Project Evaluation
Figure 15 shows the ISO/IEC 25010 model that serves as a framework for evaluating the
quality of a product. In this project, the researchers will apply the ISO/IEC 25010 model to
assess the web application, using its criteria to measure essential quality aspects such as
Functional Suitability, Performance Efficiency, Interaction Capability, Reliability, and Security.
● Functional Suitability will determine if the system will meet all the required
functionality, focusing on its accuracy, completeness and relevance for the fulfilment of
HAPAG SA MARIKINA's business needs.
● Performance Efficiency will test how good the system runs under different situations,
RestoTrack: A Web and Mobile based Inventory and POS Management Utilizing B - Tree Indexing Algorithm 63
including the ability to deal with the amount of data sent and users interacted with,
making it work how it does with the resources it has.
● Compatibility guarantees the system can optimally run on various devices and platforms
available in restaurants. The online system is tested for compatibility (receipt printers,
tablets and kitchen display systems integration) and openness to shared network
resources or browsers.
● Reliability will be assessed considering, where system stability and ability to supply
resources reliably and consistently over time, i.e., with significant low downtime and
predictable fulfillment of the resource availability requirements.
● Security will be reviewed, to further make sure the system is guarded against anything
unknown, like unauthorized access or leaks, since the sensitive data of employees and
organizations will not be put at risk. Compatibility will affect the ability of a product,
system or component to interconnect with a product, system or component, and/or work
together with a product, system or component to process data or in the way in which a
product, system or component can be used with another product, system or component.
With this quality parameter system based on the ISO/IEC 25010 model, authors can
determine literal measures that permit analysis of the performance and effectiveness of the web
application and which can provide a valuable contribution to guarantee that the final product
complies with at least minimal quality values.

Figure 15
ISO 25010
Table 12 illustrates how user feedback on the system development and progress will be
measured using the Likert scale. This assessment method is effective for the reason that it does
away with the grey area, which gets people to provide input in the more specific. This measure
emphasizes strengths and weaknesses and, in turn, yields a closer understanding of users'
perceptions. Higher scores (4–6) may indicate what works well or needs more improvement,
whereas lower ones (1–3) may point to significant problems to be attended to in time. This scale
ensures system enhancements are closely aligned with users' expectations and requirements, by
soliciting more specific and helpful feedback.
